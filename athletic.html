		<h2>Athletic Performance Monitor</h2>
		<h3>Project Description</h3>
		<p>The objective of this project was to develop a physical activity monitor that diagnoses the performance of an athlete from acceleration data and heart rate measurements, as well as notifying the coaches on the level of fatigue the athlete is experiencing. The system consists of a wearable device will reads the data from the sensors and transmit the data to an Android application via Bluetooth. The Android application will then process the data and display them to the user.<br/><br/>This project was done in collaboration with my senior design team, and my role in the project was the design and programming of the heart rate module</p>
		<h3>Components</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>TI MSP432; 32-Bit ARM Cortex M4F microcontroller</li>
			<li>BMI160 Inertial Measurement Unit</li>
			<li>BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) Module </li>
			<li>MAX30102 Pulse Oximeter</li>
			
		</ul>
		<h3>Skills and Software Used</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Project management and teamwork</li>
			<li>C programming</li>
			<li>Knowledge from embedded systems; GPIO, ADC, I2C, UART</li>
			<li>PCB Design and Soldering</li>
			
		</ul>
		<h3>Video</h3>
		<p>Unfortunately we didn't take a picture of our final product with everything put together, but click on the picture for a short video from our final demo. The man in yellow is wearing the athletic performance monitor on his sleeve and bouncing the ball to collect data while the man in grey is showing our audience the data on an app on his phone</p>
